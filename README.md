To build the ICS SPPARKS executable, first download SPPARKS from https://sjplimp.github.io//download.html. Decompress the "spparks.tar.gz" file resulting in a directory of the form "spparks-DDMon_YY" (eg. spparks-6Sep23). Navigate into the directory to the "src" directory.

cd SPPARKS_directory_path/spparks-DDMon_YY/src

Download the .cpp files found in the spparks
